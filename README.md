CoE is a thematically excellent class that isn't as powerful as other classes. I seek to buff the class and offer differing, more powerful playstyles.

- Initial commit

Demented/Nether
- Netherblast: You fire an additional shot at talent level 5.
- Netherblast (Empowered): Now pierces through 1-6 random enemies (Prioritizing furthermost ones) like Sunburst. An additional projectile is fired at Netherblast's talent level 5 to reflect the additional projectile.

        If the target is pinned, they will be silenced.
        If the target is blinded, they will be stunned.
        If the target is confused, they will be disarmed.
- Rift Cutter (Empowered): Casts an additional time.
- Spatial Distortion: Now summons the Entropic Maw as part of the spell.
- Spatial Distortion (Empowered): The Entropic Maw turns into the more powerful hungering mouth. The mouth can draw all enemies in radius 10 for 2 spaces towards itself or taunt nearby enemies with its tendrils.

Demented/Madness
- Hideous Visions: Increase spawn rate from a flat 10% to scaling from 10% to 35%. Whenever a second hallucination would spawn, the first one is immediately destroyed. Additionally, the effect from the old Sanity Warp is baked into Hideous Visions!
- Sanity Warp (Rework): 
    Spawn up to 1-3 additional hallucinations on enemies who already have one, causing the previous hallucinations to die.
    If hallucinations dying is caused by Sanity Warp, the victim is also confused for 2-7 turns at 12%-35% power.
