Cultist of Entropy is a thematically excellent class that many enjoy. I seek to buff the class and offer differing, more powerful playstyles.

The intent of this addon is to buff the budding Cultist so they have more tools at their disposal, both in terms of damage and survivability, whether passive or active.

This addon is intended to bring the class more up to the level of classes like Paradox Mage whilst including fun changes that hopefully mitigate some of the drag in CoE's early game.

The full list of all changes is visible in the changelog below.

Changelog:

1.0.1

Changed Spatial Distortion (Empowered)
- The Entropic Maw turns into the more powerful hungering mouth.
- The mouth can draw all enemies in radius 10 for 2 spaces towards itself and taunts nearby enemies in radius 4 as a free action every turn.

Netherblast
- Fixed bug with casting that made it not go into cooldown and was able to select for crits by cancelling until a crit was visible.
